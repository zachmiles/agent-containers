# Open Code

## Build Instructions

Use the top level `Makefile` to build this. It injects things in to the build
so the container works correctly for your user under `podman`.

```bash
make open-code
```

You can add more local tools to the container to be installed via `apt-get` by
extending the `LOCAL_TOOLS` list in the top-level `Makefile`.

## Run Instructions
- Just create the following file, make it executable with `chmod +x` and place it in `~/.local/bin`
- Startup is a bit slow due to container startup time, but taking ~5s startup penalty for safety measures is not so bad.
- I also add the host mapping to host.docker.internal so the container can access your localhost (useful for the agent-browser or similar MCPs to access your apps running on localhost)
- There are 4 volumes, make sure the directories in your $HOME exist and with the correct user privilege (your $UID):
  1. opencode global state - UI state, command history, model preferences, recently opened files
  2. opencode global share - Auth tokens, session data, LSP servers, git snapshots for undo, logs
  3. opencode global config - User configuration: themes, keybindings, custom commands, plugins 
  3. the repo you work - mounted as current PWD when executing `opencode` in your terminal

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

PROJ="$(basename "$(pwd)" | sed 's/[[:space:]]/-/g')"
NAME="open-code-${PROJ}"

# Remove any existing container with this name
docker rm -f "$NAME" 2>/dev/null || true

exec docker run --rm --tty --interactive \
  --name "$NAME" \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -v "$HOME/.local/state/opencode:/home/node/.local/state/opencode" \
  -v "$HOME/.local/share/opencode:/home/node/.local/share/opencode" \
  -v "$HOME/.config/opencode:/home/node/.config/opencode" \
  -v "$(pwd)":/app:rw \
  open-code "$@"
```
